    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

## Running the Project

## Customizing Messages

You can customize the interaction by editing the messages in the following format:

```bash
# Open the `src/sample.js` file in the repository
nano src/sample.js

# Modify the `messages` array to include your own context and questions
# Example:
# messages = [
#     { role: "developer", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
#     { role: "user", content: "<< - Your questions ->> "}
# ];

# Save the file and restart the application
npm start
```

This allows you to tailor the interaction to your specific needs.

## Trying the Chatbot Experience

If you want to try the chatbot experience, you can modify the `start` command in the `package.json` file as follows:

```bash
# Open the `package.json` file in the root directory
nano package.json

# Locate the `scripts` section and update the `start` command
# Example:
# "start": "node ./src/chatbot.js"

# Save the file and start the application
npm start
```

This will run the chatbot experience instead of the default sample application.

1. Stop the application by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
